133 THE OTHER MINISTER  |0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
It was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was  sitting alone in his office, reading a long memo that  was slipping through his brain without leaving the  slightest trace of meaning behind|-0.25|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 He was waiting for  a call from the President of a far distant country, and  between wondering when the wretched man would  telephone, and trying to suppress unpleasant  memories of what had been a very long, tiring, and  difficult week, there was not much space in his head  for anything else|-0.6808|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 The more he attempted to focus on  the print on the page before him, the more clearly the  Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of  his political opponents|0.4576|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 This particular opponent had  appeared on the news that very day, not only to  enumerate all the terrible things that had happened  in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding)  but also to explain why each and every one of them  was the government’s fault|-0.6808|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
  The Prime Minister’s pulse quickened at the very  thought of these accusations, for they were neither  fair nor true|-0.313|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 How on earth was his government  supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing? It  was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were  not spending enough on bridges|-0.7269|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 The bridge was  fewer than ten years old, and the best experts were at  a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two,  sending a dozen cars into the watery depths of the  river below|0.4404|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 And how dare anyone suggest that it was  lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very  nasty and well-publicized murders? Or that the  government should have somehow foreseen the freak  hurricane in the West Country that had caused so  much damage to both people and property? And was  it his fault that one of his Junior Ministers, Herbert  Chorley, had chosen this week to act so peculiarly  that he was now going to be spending a lot more time  with his family?  “A grim mood has gripped the country,” the opponent  had concluded, barely concealing his own broad grin|-0.9693|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cho Chang'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Ravenclaw Quidditch', 'Ravenclaw'}"
  And unfortunately, this was perfectly true|0.6808|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 The Prime  Minister felt it himself; people really did seem more  miserable than usual|-0.5413|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()

  He turned over the second page of the memo, saw  how much longer it went on, and gave it up as a bad  job|-0.5423|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 Stretching his arms above his head he looked  around his office mournfully|-0.4019|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 It was a handsome  room, with a fine marble fireplace facing the long sash  windows, firmly closed against the unseasonable  chill|0.6124|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 With a slight shiver, the Prime Minister got up  and moved over to the window, looking out at the thin  mist that was pressing itself against the glass|0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 It was  then, as he stood with his back to the room, that he  heard a soft cough behind him|0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()

 He turned very slowly to face the  empty room|-0.2023|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
  “Hello?” he said, trying to sound braver than he felt|0.5267|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
  For a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible  hope that nobody would answer him|0.4404|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 However, a  voice responded at once, a crisp, decisive voice that  sounded as though it were reading a prepared  statement|0.4215|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 It was coming — as the Prime Minister  had known at the first cough — from the froglike little  man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a  small, dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room|-0.4404|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()

  “Yes, I’ll see Fudge|0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
”  He hurried back to his desk, straightening his tie as  he went|0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 He had barely resumed his seat, and  arranged his face into what he hoped was a relaxed  and unfazed expression, when bright green flames  burst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble  mantelpiece|0.7845|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 He watched, trying not to betray a flicker  of surprise or alarm, as a portly man appeared within  the flames, spinning as fast as a top|0.5951|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 Seconds later,  he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug,  brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pin-striped  cloak, a lime-green bowler hat in his hand|0.6124|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
  “Ah |0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 Prime Minister,” said Cornelius Fudge, striding  forward with his hand outstretched|0.4939|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
 “Good to see you  again|0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
”  The Prime Minister could not honestly return this  compliment, so said nothing at all|0.1581|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 He was not  remotely pleased to see Fudge, whose occasional  appearances, apart from being downright alarming in  themselves, generally meant that he was about to  hear some very bad news|-0.7717|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
 Furthermore, Fudge was  looking distinctly careworn|0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
 He was thinner, balder,  and grayer, and his face had a crumpled look|0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 The  Prime Minister had seen that kind of look in  politicians before, and it never boded well|-0.2057|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
  “How can I help you?” he said, shaking Fudge’s hand  very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the  chairs in front of the desk|0.6369|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
  “Difficult to know where to begin,” muttered Fudge,  pulling up the chair, sitting down, and placing his  green bowler upon his knees|0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
 “What a week, what a  week |0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
”  “Had a bad one too, have you?” asked the Prime  Minister stiffly, hoping to convey by this that he had  quite enough on his plate already without any extra  helpings from Fudge|-0.1779|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
  “Yes, of course,” said Fudge, rubbing his eyes wearily  and looking morosely at the Prime Minister|0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}

”  “You — er — your — I mean to say, some of your  people were — were involved in those — those things,  were they?”  Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern  look|0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
 “Of course they were,” he said|0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 “Surely you’ve  realized what’s going on?”  “I |0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
” hesitated the Prime Minister|-0.3182|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
  It was precisely this sort of behavior that made him  dislike Fudge’s visits so much|-0.3818|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
 He was, after all, the  Prime Minister and did not appreciate being made to  feel like an ignorant schoolboy|-0.2163|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 But of course, it had  been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge  on his very first evening as Prime Minister|0.5023|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
 He  remembered it as though it were yesterday and knew  it would haunt him until his dying day|-0.4019|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
  He had been standing alone in this very office,  savoring the triumph that was his after so many  years of dreaming and scheming, when he had heard  a cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned to  find that ugly little portrait talking to him,  announcing that the Minister of Magic was about to  arrive and introduce himself|0.0772|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
  Naturally, he had thought that the long campaign and  the strain of the election had caused him to go mad|-0.5267|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
  He had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking  to him, though this had been nothing to how he felt  when a self-proclaimed wizard had bounced out of the  fireplace and shaken his hand|-0.3384|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 He had remained  speechless throughout Fudge’s kindly explanation  that there were witches and wizards still living in  secret all over the world and his reassurances that he  was not to bother his head about them as the  Ministry of Magic took responsibility for the whole  Wizarding community and prevented the non-magical  population from getting wind of them|0.7741|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
 It was, said  Fudge, a difficult job that encompassed everything  from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to  keeping the dragon population under control (the  Prime Minister remembered clutching the desk for  support at this point)|0.3612|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
 Fudge had then patted the  shoulder of the still-dumbstruck Prime Minister in a  fatherly sort of way|0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
  “Not to worry,” he had said, “it’s odds-on you’ll never  see me again|0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 I’ll only bother you if there’s something  really serious going on our end, something that’s  likely to affect the Muggles — the non-magical  population, I should say|-0.4576|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 Otherwise, it’s live and let  live|0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()

 He tried to throw me out the  window, thought I was a hoax planned by the  opposition|-0.2732|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
”  At this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last|0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
  “You’re — you’re not a hoax, then?”  It had been his last, desperate hope|0.343|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
  “No,” said Fudge gently|0.4588|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
 “No, I’m afraid I’m not|0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()

”  And he had turned the Prime Minister’s teacup into a  gerbil|0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
  “But,” said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching  his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech,  “but why — why has nobody told me — ?”  “The Minister of Magic only reveals him- or herself to  the Muggle Prime Minister of the day,” said Fudge,  poking his wand back inside his jacket|0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
 “We find it  the best way to maintain secrecy|0.6369|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
”  “But then,” bleated the Prime Minister, “why hasn’t a  former Prime Minister warned me — ?”  At this, Fudge had actually laughed|0.2263|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
  “My dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell  anybody?”  Still chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into  the fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames, and  vanished with a whooshing sound|0.3818|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
 The Prime  Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and  realized that he would never, as long as he lived, dare  mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the  wide world would believe him?  The shock had taken a little while to wear off|-0.3818|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 For a  time, he had tried to convince himself that Fudge had  indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of  sleep during his grueling election campaign|-0.0772|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
 In a vain  attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this  uncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to  his delighted niece and instructed his private  secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little  man who had announced Fudge’s arrival|-0.7003|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
 To the  Prime Minister’s dismay, however, the portrait had  proved impossible to remove|-0.4215|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 When several  carpenters, a builder or two, an art historian, and the  Chancellor of the Exchequer had all tried  unsuccessfully to prise it from the wall, the Prime  Minister had abandoned the attempt and simply  resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless  and silent for the rest of his term in office|-0.2732|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
  Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the  corner of his eye the occupant of the painting  yawning, or else scratching his nose; even, once or  twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving  nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind|0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
  However, he had trained himself not to look at the  picture very much, and always to tell himself firmly  that his eyes were playing tricks on him when  anything like this happened|0.4215|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
  Then, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the  Prime Minister had been alone in his office when the  portrait had once again announced the imminent  arrival of Fudge, who had burst out of the fireplace,  sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic|-0.4215|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
  Before the Prime Minister could ask why he was  dripping all over the Axminster, Fudge had started  ranting about a prison the Prime Minister had never  heard of, a man named “Serious” Black, something  that sounded like “Hogwarts,” and a boy called Harry  Potter, none of which made the remotest sense to the  Prime Minister|-0.2023|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Sirius Black', 'Cornelius Fudge'}|"{'Order of the Phoenix', 'Marauders', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Ministry', 'Black Family', 'Potter Family'}"

 Fudge pulled out  his wand, conjured two large glasses full of amber  liquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the  Prime Minister’s hand, and drew up a chair|0.4939|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}
  Fudge had talked for more than an hour|0.0|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}

 Less than a year  later a harassed-looking Fudge had appeared out of  thin air in the cabinet room to inform the Prime  Minister that there had been a spot of bother at the  Kwidditch (or that was what it had sounded like)  World Cup and that several Muggles had been  “involved,” but that the Prime Minister was not to  worry, the fact that You-Know- Who’s Mark had been  seen again meant nothing; Fudge was sure it was an  isolated incident, and the Muggle Liaison Office was  dealing with all memory modifications as they spoke|-0.3036|133 The Other Minister  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Cornelius Fudge'}|{'Ministry'}

True, there was little of the journey left — Hogsmeade  Station had to be less than half an hour away,  judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the  windows — but nobody else seemed prepared to take  Harry’s suspicions seriously, so it was down to him to  prove them|-0.4497|139 The Slug Club  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family'}"
  “I’ll see you two later,” said Harry under his breath,  pulling out his Invisibility Cloak and flinging it over  himself|0.0|139 The Slug Club  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family'}"

  “Later!” whispered Harry, darting after Zabini as  quietly as possible, though the rattling of the train  made such caution almost pointless|0.0|139 The Slug Club  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Blaise Zabini', 'Harry Potter'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Slytherin', 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family'}"

 Though he was as close as he could get  to Zabini without touching him, Harry was not quick  enough to slip into the compartment when Zabini  opened the door|0.0|139 The Slug Club  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Blaise Zabini', 'Harry Potter'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Slytherin', 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family'}"
 Zabini was already sliding it shut  when Harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it  closing|-0.2263|139 The Slug Club  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Blaise Zabini', 'Harry Potter'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Slytherin', 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family'}"
  “What’s wrong with this thing?” said Zabini angrily as  he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into Harry’s  foot|-0.7096|139 The Slug Club  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Blaise Zabini', 'Harry Potter'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Slytherin', 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family'}"
  Harry seized the door and pushed it open, hard;  Zabini, still clinging on to the handle, toppled over  sideways into Gregory Goyle’s lap, and in the ensuing  ruckus, Harry darted into the compartment, leapt  onto Zabini’s temporarily empty seat, and hoisted  himself up into the luggage rack|-0.296|139 The Slug Club  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Blaise Zabini', 'Harry Potter', 'Gregory Goyle'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Slytherin', 'Slytherin Quidditch', 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Inquisitorial Squad', 'Potter Family'}"
 It was fortunate that  Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing  all eyes onto them, for Harry was quite sure his feet  and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had  flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible  moment he thought he saw Malfoy’s eyes follow his  trainer as it whipped upward out of sight|0.2484|139 The Slug Club  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Blaise Zabini', 'Harry Potter', 'Draco Malfoy', 'Gregory Goyle'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Slytherin', 'Slytherin Quidditch', 'Gryffindor', 'Prefect', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Inquisitorial Squad', 'Potter Family'}"

 Harry lay  curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that  every inch of him remained hidden, and watched  Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoy’s  forehead, smirking as she did so, as though anyone  would have loved to have been in her place|0.5859|139 The Slug Club  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Pansy Parkinson', 'Harry Potter', 'Draco Malfoy'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Slytherin', 'Slytherin Quidditch', 'Gryffindor', 'Prefect', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Inquisitorial Squad', 'Potter Family'}"

  Harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and  confused by a series of dreams in which Ron had  chased him with a Beater’s bat, but by midday he  would have happily exchanged the dream Ron for the  real one, who was not only cold-shouldering Ginny  and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered  Hermione with an icy, sneering indifference|0.4364|146 Felix Felicis  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Ron Weasley', 'Ginny Weasley', 'Harry Potter', 'Dean Thomas', 'Hermione Granger'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', 'Prefect', 'Weasley Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family'}"

 Worse still, it coincided  with an even deeper dip in his Keeping skills, which  made him still more aggressive, so that during the  final Quidditch practice before Saturday’s match, he  failed to save every single goal the Chasers aimed at  him, but bellowed at everybody so much that he  reduced Demelza Robins to tears|-0.5989|146 Felix Felicis  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Demelza Robins'}|{'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Gryffindor'}

  So Dumbledore had argued with Snape|-0.4144|151 Elf Tails  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Severus Snape'}|{'Order of the Phoenix', 'Teacher'}
 In spite of all  he had told Harry, in spite of his insistence that he  trusted Snape completely, he had lost his temper with  him|-0.8428|151 Elf Tails  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Severus Snape', 'Harry Potter'}|"{'Order of the Phoenix', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family', 'Teacher'}"

 or, perhaps, to  investigate a single Slytherin: Malfoy?  Was it because Dumbledore did not want Harry to do  anything foolish, to take matters into his own hands,  that he had pretended there was nothing in Harry’s  suspicions?

 In fact, the Gryffindors  were generally much more interested in the upcoming  Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, for many of them  wanted to see Zacharias Smith, who played Chaser on  the Hufflepuff team, punished soundly for his  commentary during the opening match against  Slytherin|0.3384|151 Elf Tails  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Godric Gryffindor', 'Salazar Slytherin', 'Zacharias Smith', 'Helga Hufflepuff'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Slytherin', 'Gryffindor', 'Hufflepuff', 'Hufflepuff Quidditch', 'Founder'}"
  Harry, however, had never been less interested in  Quidditch; he was rapidly becoming obsessed with  Draco Malfoy|-0.41|151 Elf Tails  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Draco Malfoy'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Slytherin', 'Slytherin Quidditch', 'Gryffindor', 'Prefect', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Inquisitorial Squad', 'Potter Family'}"
 Still checking the Marauder’s Map  whenever he got a chance, he sometimes made  detours to wherever Malfoy happened to be, but had  not yet detected him doing anything out of the  ordinary|0.128|151 Elf Tails  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Draco Malfoy'}|{'Slytherin', 'Slytherin Quidditch', 'Inquisitorial Squad', 'Prefect'}

  But Harry did not get a lot of time to consider the  problem, what with Quidditch practice, homework,  and the fact that he was now being dogged wherever  he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown|-0.5499|151 Elf Tails  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Lavender Brown', 'Harry Potter', 'Cormac McLaggen'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family'}"
  He could not decide which of them was more  annoying|-0.4576|151 Elf Tails  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()
 McLaggen kept up a constant stream of  hints that he would make a better permanent Keeper  for the team than Ron, and that now that Harry was  seeing him play regularly he would surely come  around to this way of thinking too; he was also keen  to criticize the other players and provide Harry with  detailed training schemes, so that more than once  Harry was forced to remind him who was Captain|0.6249|151 Elf Tails  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Ron Weasley', 'Harry Potter', 'Cormac McLaggen'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio', 'Prefect', 'Weasley Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family'}"

 At first,  Lavender had been very annoyed that nobody had  thought to tell her that Ron was in the hospital wing  — “I mean, I am his girlfriend!” — but unfortunately  she had now decided to forgive Harry this lapse of  memory and was keen to have lots of in-depth chats  with him about Ron’s feelings, a most uncomfortable  experience that Harry would have happily forgone|0.4949|151 Elf Tails  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Lavender Brown', 'Ron Weasley', 'Harry Potter'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio', 'Prefect', 'Weasley Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family'}"
  “Look, why don’t you talk to Ron about all this?”  Harry asked, after a particularly long interrogation  from Lavender that took in everything from precisely  what Ron had said about her new dress robes to  whether or not Harry thought that Ron considered his  relationship with Lavender to be “serious|0.0|151 Elf Tails  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Lavender Brown', 'Ron Weasley', 'Harry Potter'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio', 'Prefect', 'Weasley Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family'}"

 “Anyway — sorry, got to go — there’s  McLaggen coming for a talk about Quidditch,” said  Harry hurriedly, and he dashed sideways through a  door pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down  the shortcut that would take him off to Potions where,  thankfully, neither Lavender nor McLaggen could  follow him|0.5423|151 Elf Tails  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Lavender Brown', 'Harry Potter', 'Cormac McLaggen'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family'}"

  “You’d do better,” said Hermione, when he confided  this plan to Ron and her in the entrance hall, “to go  straight to Slughorn’s office and try and get that  memory from him|0.2263|153 The Unknowable Room  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Horace Slughorn', 'Ron Weasley', 'Hermione Granger'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', 'Prefect', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Weasley Family', 'Teacher'}"

 Harry, laughing with the others,  was glad to have an innocent reason to look at Ginny;  he had received several more Bludger injuries during  practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on  the Snitch|0.8225|156 Sectumsempra  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Ginny Weasley', 'Harry Potter'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio', 'Weasley Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family'}"
  The battle still raged inside his head: Ginny or Ron?

 And to  complicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if  he didn’t do it, somebody else was sure to ask Ginny  out soon: He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact  that she was too popular for her own good|0.5574|156 Sectumsempra  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Ron Weasley', 'Ginny Weasley'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Prefect', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Weasley Family'}"
  All in all, the temptation to take another gulp of Felix  Felicis was becoming stronger by the day, for surely  this was a case for, as Hermione put it, “tweaking the  circumstances”?

 Harry found himself longing  for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause Ron to  realize that nothing would make him happier than his  best friend and his sister falling for each other and to  leave them alone together for longer than a few  seconds|0.8979|156 Sectumsempra  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Ron Weasley', 'Harry Potter'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio', 'Prefect', 'Weasley Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family'}"
 There seemed no chance of either while the  final Quidditch game of the season was looming; Ron  wanted to talk tactics with Harry all the time and had  little thought for anything else|-0.3049|156 Sectumsempra  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Ron Weasley', 'Harry Potter'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio', 'Prefect', 'Weasley Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family'}"
  Ron was not unique in this respect; interest in the  Gryffindor-Ravenclaw game was running extremely  high throughout the school, for the match would  decide the Championship, which was still wide open|0.8599|156 Sectumsempra  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Rowena Ravenclaw', 'Godric Gryffindor', 'Ron Weasley'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Prefect', 'Ravenclaw', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Founder', 'Weasley Family'}"
  If Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw by a margin of three  hundred points (a tall order, and yet Harry had never  known his team to fly better) then they would win the  Championship|0.8625|156 Sectumsempra  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Rowena Ravenclaw', 'Godric Gryffindor', 'Harry Potter'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio', 'Ravenclaw', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Founder', 'Potter Family'}"
 If they won by less than three  hundred points, they would come second to  Ravenclaw; if they lost by a hundred points they  would be third behind Hufflepuff and if they lost by  more than a hundred, they would be in fourth place  and nobody, Harry thought, would ever, ever let him  forget that it had been he who had captained  Gryffindor to their first bottom-of-the-table defeat in  two centuries|-0.5859|156 Sectumsempra  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Rowena Ravenclaw', 'Godric Gryffindor', 'Harry Potter', 'Helga Hufflepuff'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio', 'Hufflepuff', 'Ravenclaw', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Founder', 'Potter Family'}"
  The run-up to this crucial match had all the usual  features: members of rival Houses attempting to  intimidate opposing teams in the corridors;  unpleasant chants about individual players being  rehearsed loudly as they passed; the team members  themselves either swaggering around enjoying all the  attention or else dashing into bathrooms between  classes to throw up|-0.128|156 Sectumsempra  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()

 He could not help  feeling that if they won by more than three hundred  points, the scenes of euphoria and a nice loud after-  match party might be just as good as a hearty swig of  Felix Felicis|0.9296|156 Sectumsempra  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|set()|set()

  A few days before the match against Ravenclaw,  Harry found himself walking down to dinner alone  from the common room, Ron having rushed off into a  nearby bathroom to throw up yet again, and  Hermione having dashed off to see Professor Vector  about a mistake she thought she might have made in  her last Arithmancy essay|-0.5267|156 Sectumsempra  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Septima Vector', 'Ron Weasley', 'Harry Potter', 'Rowena Ravenclaw', 'Hermione Granger'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', 'Prefect', 'Ravenclaw', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Weasley Family', 'Founder', 'Potter Family', 'Teacher'}"

 “Stop!

 She met Harry’s gaze  with the same hard, blazing look that he had seen  when she had hugged him after winning the  Quidditch Cup in his absence, and he knew that at  that moment they understood each other perfectly,  and that when he told her what he was going to do  now, she would not say, “Be careful,” or “Don’t do it,”  but accept his decision, because she would not have  expected anything less of him|0.7391|162 The White Tomb  |6 Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family'}"
