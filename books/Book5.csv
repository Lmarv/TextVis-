The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to  a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square  houses of Privet Drive|0.0|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|set()|set()
 Cars that were usually  gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that  were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing;  the use of hosepipes had been banned due to  drought|-0.4588|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|set()|set()
 Deprived of their usual car-washing and  lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive  had retreated into the shade of their cool houses,  windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a  nonexistent breeze|0.2732|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|set()|set()
 The only person left outdoors was  a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a  flower bed outside number four|-0.4767|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|set()|set()
  He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who  had the pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone  who has grown a lot in a short space of time|-0.4779|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|set()|set()
 His  jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy and  faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away  from the uppers|-0.5994|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|set()|set()
 Harry Potter’s appearance did not  endear him to the neighbors, who were the sort of  people who thought scruffiness ought to be  punishable by law, but as he had hidden himself  behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was  quite invisible to passersby|-0.2382|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army""}"
 In fact, the only way he  would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt  Petunia stuck their heads out of the living room  window and looked straight down into the flower bed  below|-0.0258|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Petunia Dursley', 'Vernon Dursley'}|{'Dursley Family'}

 He was not,  perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard  earth, but on the other hand, nobody was glaring at  him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not  hear the news, or shooting nasty questions at him, as  had happened every time he had tried sitting down in  the living room and watching television with his aunt  and uncle|-0.6247|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|set()|set()

 She was frowning  and muttering to herself|-0.34|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|set()|set()
 Harry was very pleased that  he was concealed behind the bush; Mrs Figg had  recently taken to asking him around for tea whenever  she met him in the street|0.4927|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Arabella Figg', 'Harry Potter'}|"{'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family', 'Golden Trio', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army""}"
 She had rounded the  corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon’s  voice floated out of the window again|0.0|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Vernon Dursley'}|{'Dursley Family'}

 The Dursleys  really were astonishingly stupid about their son,  Dudley; they had swallowed all his dim-witted lies  about having tea with a different member of his gang  every night of the summer holidays|-0.5945|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Dudley Dursley'}|{'Dursley Family'}
 Harry knew  perfectly well that Dudley had not been to tea  anywhere; he and his gang spent every evening  vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners,  and throwing stones at passing cars and children|0.8271|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Dudley Dursley'}|"{'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Dursley Family'}"
  Harry had seen them at it during his evening walks  around Little Whinging; he had spent most of the  holidays wandering the streets, scavenging  newspapers from bins along the way|0.4336|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army""}"

 Perhaps tonight — after a  month of waiting — would be the night —  “Record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill  airports as the Spanish baggage-handlers’ strike  reaches its second week — ”  “Give ’em a lifelong siesta, I would,” snarled Uncle  Vernon over the end of the newsreader’s sentence,  but no matter: Outside in the flower bed, Harry’s  stomach seemed to unclench|-0.0286|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Vernon Dursley'}|"{'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Dursley Family'}"
 If anything had  happened, it would surely have been the first item on  the news; death and destruction were more important  than stranded holidaymakers|-0.5584|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|set()|set()
  He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the  brilliant blue sky|0.5859|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|set()|set()
 Every day this summer had been  the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary  relief, and then mounting tension again |-0.128|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|set()|set()
 and  always, growing more insistent all the time, the  question of why nothing had happened yet|0.1779|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|set()|set()
  He kept listening, just in case there was some small  clue, not recognized for what it really was by the  Muggles — an unexplained disappearance,  perhaps, or some strange accident |-0.5994|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|set()|set()
 but the  baggage-handlers’ strike was followed by news on the  drought in the Southeast (“I hope he’s listening next  door!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, “with his sprinklers on  at three in the morning!”); then a helicopter that had  almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous  actress’s divorce from her famous husband (“as if  we’re interested in their sordid affairs,” sniffed Aunt  Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively in  every magazine she could lay her bony hands on)|0.7673|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Petunia Dursley', 'Vernon Dursley'}|{'Dursley Family'}
  Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening  sky as the newsreader said, “And finally, Bungy the  budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this  summer|0.5574|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army""}"

 He rolled cautiously onto his front and  raised himself onto his knees and elbows, preparing  to crawl out from under the window|0.0|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|set()|set()
  He had moved about two inches when several things  happened in very quick succession|0.2682|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|set()|set()
  A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a  gunshot; a cat streaked out from under a parked car  and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath, and  the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys’  living room, and as though Harry had been waiting  for this signal, he jumped to his feet, at the same time  pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden  wand as if he were unsheathing a sword|-0.0772|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army""}"
 But before  he could draw himself up to full height, the top of his  head collided with the Dursleys’ open window, and  the resultant crash made Aunt Petunia scream even  louder|-0.7096|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Petunia Dursley'}|{'Dursley Family'}
  Harry felt as if his head had been split in two; eyes  streaming, he swayed, trying to focus on the street  and spot the source of the noise, but he had barely  staggered upright again when two large purple hands  reached through the open window and closed tightly  around his throat|0.1531|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army""}"
  “Put — it — away\” Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry’s  ear|0.0|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Vernon Dursley'}|"{'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Dursley Family'}"
 “Now\ Before — anyone — sees!”  “Get — off — me!” Harry gasped; for a few seconds  they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncle’s sausage-  like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a  firm grip on his raised wand|0.5972|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army""}"
 Then, as the pain in the  top of Harry’s head gave a particularly nasty throb,  Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he  had received an electric shock — some invisible force  seemed to have surged through his nephew, making  him impossible to hold|-0.8399|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Vernon Dursley'}|"{'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Dursley Family'}"
  Panting, Harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush,  straightened up, and stared around|0.0|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army""}"
 There was no  sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise, but  there were several faces peering through various  nearby windows|-0.1531|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|set()|set()
 Harry stuffed his wand hastily back  into his jeans and tried to look innocent|0.34|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army""}"
  “Lovely evening!” shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at  Mrs Number Seven, who was glaring from behind her  net curtains|0.1511|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Vernon Dursley'}|{'Dursley Family'}
 “Did you hear that car backfire just  now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!”  He continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all  the curious neighbors had disappeared from their  various windows, then the grin became a grimace of  rage as he beckoned Harry back toward him|-0.4199|95 Dudley Demented  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Petunia Dursley', 'Harry Potter'}|"{'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Dursley Family'}"

  Tomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm  at five o’clock so that he could pay the owl that  delivered the Daily Prophet — but was there any point  in continuing to take it?

  They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument,  something like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which  scuttled up Harry’s arm like a spider when he picked  it up, and attempted to puncture his skin; Sirius  seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled  Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy|0.7269|100 The Noble And Most Ancient House Of Black  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Sirius Black'}|"{'Black Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Potter Family', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', 'Marauders'}"
 There was a  musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling  tune when wound, and they all found themselves  becoming curiously weak and sleepy until Ginny had  the sense to slam the lid shut; also a heavy locket  that none of them could open, a number of ancient  seals and, in a dusty box, an Order of Merlin, First  Class, that had been awarded to Sirius’s grandfather  for “Services to the Ministry|-0.7506|100 The Noble And Most Ancient House Of Black  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Ginny Weasley', 'Sirius Black'}|"{'Black Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Weasley Family', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Gryffindor', 'Marauders'}"

 The drawing room took three days  to decontaminate; finally the only undesirable things  left in it were the tapestry of the Black family tree,  which resisted all their attempts to remove it from the  wall, and the rattling writing desk; Moody had not  dropped by headquarters yet, so they could not be  sure what was inside it|-0.7478|100 The Noble And Most Ancient House Of Black  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Sirius Black'}|{'Black Family', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Marauders'}
  They moved from the drawing room to a dining room  on the ground floor where they found spiders large as  saucers lurking in the dresser (Ron left the room  hurriedly to make a cup of tea and did not return for  an hour and a half) |-0.128|100 The Noble And Most Ancient House Of Black  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Ron Weasley'}|"{'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Weasley Family', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Prefect'}"
 The china, which bore the Black  crest and motto, was all thrown unceremoniously into  a sack by Sirius, and the same fate met a set of old  photographs in tarnished silver frames, all of whose  occupants squealed shrilly as the glass covering them  smashed|-0.25|100 The Noble And Most Ancient House Of Black  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Sirius Black'}|{'Black Family', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Marauders'}
  Snape might refer to their work as “cleaning,” but in  Harry’s opinion they were really waging war on the  house, which was putting up a very good fight, aided  and abetted by Kreacher|-0.7427|100 The Noble And Most Ancient House Of Black  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Kreacher', 'Severus Snape'}|"{'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family', 'House-Elf', 'Golden Trio', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Teacher'}"

 Sirius went as far as to threaten him  with clothes, but Kreacher fixed him with a watery  stare and said, “Master must do as Master wishes,”  before turning away and muttering very loudly, “but  Master will not turn Kreacher away, no, because  Kreacher knows what they are up to, oh yes, he is  plotting against the Dark Lord, yes, with these  Mudbloods and traitors and scum|0.743|100 The Noble And Most Ancient House Of Black  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Kreacher', 'Sirius Black'}|{'Black Family', 'House-Elf', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Marauders'}

  The doorbell rang several times a day, which was the  cue for Sirius’s mother to start shrieking again, and  for Harry and the others to attempt to eavesdrop on  the visitor, though they gleaned very little from the  brief glimpses and snatches of conversation they were  able to sneak before Mrs Weasley recalled them to  their tasks|0.0|100 The Noble And Most Ancient House Of Black  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Molly Weasley', 'Harry Potter', 'Sirius Black'}|"{'Black Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Weasley Family', 'Potter Family', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', 'Marauders'}"
 Snape flitted in and out of the house  several times more, though to Harry’s relief they never  came face-to-face; he also caught sight of his  Transfiguration teacher, Professor McGonagall,  looking very odd in a Muggle dress and coat, though  she also seemed too busy to linger|0.1298|100 The Noble And Most Ancient House Of Black  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Minerva McGonagall', 'Severus Snape'}|"{'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Teacher'}"
  Sometimes, however, the visitors stayed to help;  Tonks joined them for a memorable afternoon in  which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in  an upstairs toilet, and Lupin, who was staying in the  house with Sirius but who left it for long periods to do  mysterious work for the Order, helped them repair a  grandfather clock that had developed the unpleasant  habit of shooting heavy bolts at passersby|-0.7311|100 The Noble And Most Ancient House Of Black  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Remus Lupin', 'Nymphadora Tonks', 'Sirius Black'}|{'Black Family', 'Ministry', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Marauders', 'Teacher'}

 Yes, I am sure  you are surprised to hear this — no doubt you will say  that Potter has always been Dumbledore’s favorite —  but I feel bound to tell you that Dumbledore may not be  in charge at Hogwarts much longer and the people who  count have a very different — and probably more  accurate — view of Potters behavior|0.671|108 Percy And Padfoot  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|set()|set()

 Some, like Fred, George, and Lee, roared  with delight and sprinted up the aisle between the  Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables to wring Hagrid’s  enormous hand; others, like Parvati and Lavender,  exchanged gloomy looks and shook their heads|0.8923|115 The Eye Of The Snake  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Godric Gryffindor', 'Parvati Patil', 'Fred Weasley', 'Lee Jordan', 'Lavender Brown', 'Rubeus Hagrid', 'Helga Hufflepuff', 'George Weasley'}|"{'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Weasley Family', 'Gamekeeper', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Hufflepuff', 'Founder', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Teacher'}"
 Harry  knew that many of them preferred Professor Grubbly-  Plank’s lessons, and the worst of it was that a very  small, unbiased part of him knew that they had good  reason: Grubbly-Plank’s idea of an interesting class  was not one where there was a risk that somebody  might have their head ripped off|-0.2449|115 The Eye Of The Snake  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank'}|"{'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family', 'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Teacher'}"

 Harry  was worried, not only about what Hagrid might have  decided to teach them, but also about how the rest of  the class, particularly Malfoy and his cronies, would  behave if Umbridge was watching them|-0.1531|115 The Eye Of The Snake  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|{'Draco Malfoy', 'Harry Potter', 'Rubeus Hagrid', 'Dolores Umbridge'}|"{'Slytherin Quidditch', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Ministry', 'Slytherin', 'Potter Family', 'Gamekeeper', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Golden Trio', 'Prefect', 'Inquisitorial Squad', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Teacher'}"

 Harry could not understand  this: Had Hagrid perhaps been attacked by some  creature whose venom prevented the wounds it  inflicted from healing?

  A pair of blank, white, shining eyes were growing  larger through the gloom and a moment later the  dragonish face, neck, and then skeletal body of a  great, black, winged horse emerged from the  darkness|0.0516|115 The Eye Of The Snake  |5 Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix|[]|set()|set()
