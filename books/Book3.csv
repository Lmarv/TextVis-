Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways|0.0|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch'}"
  For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more  than any other time of year|-0.3818|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|set()|set()
 For another, he really  wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in  secret, in the dead of night|-0.899|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|set()|set()
 And he also happened to  be a wizard|0.0|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|set()|set()
  It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his  stomach in bed, the blankets drawn right over his  head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand and a large  leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda  Bagshot) propped open against the pillow|0.3182|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|{'Bathilda Bagshot'}|set()
 Harry  moved the tip of his eagle-feather quill down the page,  frowning as he looked for something that would help  him write his essay, “Witch Burning in the Fourteenth  Century Was Completely Pointless — discuss|0.0772|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch'}"

 Harry pushed his round glasses up the  bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer to the  book, and read:  Non-magic people (more commonly known as  Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval  times, but not very good at recognizing it|-0.5321|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch'}"
 On the rare  occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard,  burning had no effect whatsoever|-0.5719|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|set()|set()
 The witch or wizard  would perform a basic Flame Freezing Charm and  then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a  gentle, tickling sensation|0.34|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|set()|set()
 Indeed, Wendelin the Weird  enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed  herself to be caught no less than forty-seven times in  various disguises|-0.1531|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|set()|set()
  Harry put his quill between his teeth and reached  underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of  parchment|0.1027|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch'}"
 Slowly and very carefully he unscrewed  the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to  write, pausing every now and then to listen, because  if any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill  on their way to the bathroom, he’d probably find  himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for  the rest of the summer|0.2006|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|set()|set()
  The Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was  the reason that Harry never enjoyed his summer  holidays|0.0511|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch'}"

 For years, Aunt Petunia and  Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as  downtrodden as possible, they would be able to  squash the magic out of him|0.3818|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|{'Vernon Dursley', 'Petunia Dursley', 'Harry Potter'}|"{'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Dursley Family', 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch'}"
 To their fury, they had  been unsuccessful|-0.7351|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|set()|set()
 These days they lived in terror of  anyone finding out that Harry had spent most of the  last two years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and  Wizardry|-0.5267|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch'}"
 The most they could do, however, was to  lock away Harry’s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and  broomstick at the start of the summer break, and  forbid him to talk to the neighbors|-0.3182|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch'}"
  This separation from his spellbooks had been a real  problem for Harry, because his teachers at Hogwarts  had given him a lot of holiday work|0.0|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch'}"
 One of the  essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking  potions, was for Harry’s least favorite teacher,  Professor Snape, who would be delighted to have an  excuse to give Harry detention for a month|-0.6455|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Severus Snape'}|"{'Golden Trio', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Teacher', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch'}"

 While Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and  Dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire  Uncle Vernon’s new company car (in very loud voices,  so that the rest of the street would notice it too),  Harry had crept downstairs, picked the lock on the  cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of his  books, and hidden them in his bedroom|0.4767|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|{'Dudley Dursley', 'Vernon Dursley', 'Petunia Dursley', 'Harry Potter'}|"{'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Dursley Family', 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch'}"

  Harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his  aunt and uncle at the moment, as they were already  in an especially bad mood with him, all because he’d  received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one  week into the school vacation|-0.7322|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch'}"

  “HELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME?

 Harry suspected that Ron had  warned Hermione not to call, which was a pity,  because Hermione, the cleverest witch in Harry’s  year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to  use a telephone, and would probably have had  enough sense not to say that she went to Hogwarts|0.4939|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Hermione Granger', 'Ron Weasley'}|"{'Golden Trio', 'Weasley Family', 'Gryffindor', 'Prefect', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch'}"

 There  was just one very small improvement — after  swearing that he wouldn’t use her to send letters to  any of his friends, Harry had been allowed to let his  owl, Hedwig, out at night|0.6573|36 Owl Post  |3 Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Hedwig'}|"{'Golden Trio', 'Pet', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch'}"
