 As their eyes grew  accustomed to the lack of light, they were drawn  upward to the strangest feature of the scene: an  apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside  down over the table, revolving slowly as if suspended  by an invisible rope, and reflected in the mirror and in  the bare, polished surface of the table below|-0.6597|163 The Dark Lord Ascending  |7 Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows|[]|set()|set()

 Why exactly did Aberforth  Dumbledore blame Albus for his sister’s death? Was  it, as “Batty” pretends, a mere effusion of grief? Or  could there have been some more concrete reason for  his fury? Grindelwald, expelled from Durmstrang for  near-fatal attacks upon fellow students, fled the  country hours after the girl’s death, and Albus (out of  shame or fear?) never saw him again, not until forced  to do so by the pleas of the Wizarding world|-0.9802|180 The Life And Lies Of Albus Dumbledore  |7 Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows|[]|{'Gellert Grindelwald', 'Aberforth Dumbledore', 'Albus Dumbledore'}|{'Teacher', 'Headmaster', 'Order of the Phoenix'}

  Was it lingering affection for the man or fear of  exposure as his once best friend that caused  Dumbledore to hesitate? Was it only reluctantly that  Dumbledore set out to capture the man he was once  so delighted he had met?  And how did the mysterious Ariana die? Was she the  inadvertent victim of some Dark rite? Did she stumble  across something she ought not to have done, as the  two young men sat practicing for their attempt at  glory and domination?

 Harry looked back at  Travers, who was still rooted to the spot looking  abnormally vacant, and made his decision: With a  flick of his wand he made Travers come with them,  walking meekly in their wake as they reached the  door and passed into the rough stone passageway  beyond, which was lit with flaming torches|0.1027|188 Gringotts  |7 Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Travers'}|"{'Golden Trio', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Death Eater', 'Potter Family'}"

  They might as well have left enormous footprints  behind them; the more he thought about it, the more  foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as  Bellatrix, to have brought along Bellatrix’s wand,  when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it —  They were deeper than Harry had ever penetrated  within Gringotts; they took a hairpin bend at speed  and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a  waterfall pounding over the track|-0.8588|188 Gringotts  |7 Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows|[]|{'Hermione Granger', 'Bellatrix Lestrange', 'Harry Potter'}|"{'Golden Trio', 'Black Family', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Death Eater', 'Prefect', 'Potter Family'}"

  “C-Cushioning Charm,” Hermione spluttered, as Ron  pulled her to her feet, but to Harry’s horror he saw  that she was no longer Bellatrix; instead she stood  there in overlarge robes, sopping wet and completely  herself; Ron was red-haired and beardless again|-0.8338|188 Gringotts  |7 Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows|[]|{'Hermione Granger', 'Ron Weasley', 'Bellatrix Lestrange', 'Harry Potter'}|"{'Golden Trio', 'Weasley Family', 'Black Family', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Death Eater', 'Prefect', 'Potter Family'}"

 Its great spiked  wings, folded close to its body, would have filled the  chamber if it spread them, and when it turned its  ugly head toward them, it roared with a noise that  made the rock tremble, opened its mouth, and spat a  jet of fire that sent them running back up the  passageway|-0.4019|188 Gringotts  |7 Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows|[]|set()|set()

 The old goblin obeyed, pressing his palm to  the wood, and the door of the vault melted away to  reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to  ceiling with golden coins and goblets, silver armor,  the skins of strange creatures — some with long  spines, others with drooping wings — potions in  jeweled flasks, and a skull still wearing a crown|-0.2023|188 Gringotts  |7 Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows|[]|set()|set()

 The Slytherin table  was completely deserted, but a number of older  Ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed  out; even more Hufflepuffs stayed behind, and half of  Gryffindor remained in their seats, necessitating  Professor McGonagall’s descent from the teachers’  platform to chivvy the underage on their way|0.1154|193 The Battle Of Hogwarts  |7 Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows|[]|{'Salazar Slytherin', 'Godric Gryffindor', 'Rowena Ravenclaw', 'Minerva McGonagall', 'Helga Hufflepuff'}|{'Hufflepuff', 'Teacher', 'Gryffindor', 'Founder', 'Ravenclaw', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Slytherin'}

  “All right, leaders up here and we’ll divide up the  troops!”  “Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, hurrying up to  him, as students flooded the platform, jostling for  position, receiving instructions, “ Aren’t you supposed  to be looking for something?”  “What? Oh,” said Harry, “oh yeah!”  He had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost  forgotten that the battle was being fought so that he  could search for it: The inexplicable absence of Ron  and Hermione had momentarily driven every other  thought from his mind|-0.794|193 The Battle Of Hogwarts  |7 Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows|[]|{'Hermione Granger', 'Ron Weasley', 'Minerva McGonagall', 'Harry Potter'}|"{'Teacher', 'Golden Trio', 'Weasley Family', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Prefect', 'Potter Family'}"

The world had ended, so why had the battle not  ceased, the castle fallen silent in horror, and every  combatant laid down their arms? Harry’s mind was in  free fall, spinning out of control, unable to grasp the  impossibility, because Fred Weasley could not be  dead, the evidence of all his senses must be lying —  And then a body fell past the hole blown into the side  of the school, and curses flew in at them from the  darkness, hitting the wall behind their heads|-0.7549|194 The Elder Wand  |7 Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Fred Weasley'}|"{'Golden Trio', 'Weasley Family', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Potter Family'}"
