58 THE RIDDLE HOUSE  |0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
The villagers of Little Hangleton still called it “the  Riddle House,” even though it had been many years  since the Riddle family had lived there|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|set()
 It stood on a  hill overlooking the village, some of its windows  boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading  unchecked over its face|-0.296|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Once a fine-looking manor,  and easily the largest and grandest building for miles  around, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict,  and unoccupied|0.7003|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|set()
  The Little Hangletons all agreed that the old house  was “creepy|0.2111|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
” Half a century ago, something strange  and horrible had happened there, something that the  older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss  when topics for gossip were scarce|-0.4939|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 The story had  been picked over so many times, and had been  embroidered in so many places, that nobody was  quite sure what the truth was anymore|0.5984|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Every version  of the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty  years before, at daybreak on a fine summer’s  morning, when the Riddle House had still been well  kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing  room to find all three Riddles dead|0.2263|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|set()
  The maid had run screaming down the hill into the  village and roused as many people as she could|-0.3818|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  “Lying there with their eyes wide open! Cold as ice!  Still in their dinner things!”  The police were summoned, and the whole of Little  Hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill-  disguised excitement|-0.5962|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Nobody wasted their breath  pretending to feel very sad about the Riddles, for they  had been most unpopular|-0.7346|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|set()
 Elderly Mr and Mrs  Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their  grown-up son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse|-0.5267|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|set()
 All  the villagers cared about was the identity of their  murderer — for plainly, three apparently healthy  people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the  same night|0.7688|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  The Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade  that night; the whole village seemed to have turned  out to discuss the murders|-0.6124|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 They were rewarded for  leaving their firesides when the Riddles’ cook arrived  dramatically in their midst and announced to the  suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce  had just been arrested|0.0258|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Frank Bryce', 'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|{'Muggle'}
  “Frank!” cried several people|-0.4389|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 “Never!”  Frank Bryce was the Riddles’ gardener|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Frank Bryce', 'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|{'Muggle'}
 He lived alone  in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the Riddle  House|-0.25|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|set()
 Frank had come back from the war with a  very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud  noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever  since|-0.34|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|set()
  There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear  more details|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()

 That’s no reason to  “Who else had a key to the back door, then?” barked  the cook|-0.296|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 “There’s been a spare key hanging in the  gardener’s cottage far back as I can remember!  Nobody forced the door last night! No broken  windows! All Frank had to do was creep up to the big  house while we was all sleeping|-0.323|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
”  The villagers exchanged dark looks|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  “I always thought he had a nasty look about him,  right enough,” grunted a man at the bar|-0.5574|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  “War turned him funny, if you ask me,” said the  landlord|0.4404|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  “Told you I wouldn’t like to get on the wrong side of  Frank, didn’t I, Dot?” said an excited woman in the  corner|0.2023|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()

”  By the following morning, hardly anyone in Little  Hangleton doubted that Frank Bryce had killed the  Riddles|-0.7447|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Frank Bryce', 'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|{'Muggle'}
  But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton,  in the dark and dingy police station, Frank was  stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was  innocent, and that the only person he had seen near  the house on the day of the Riddles’ deaths had been  a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale|0.7684|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|set()
  Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and  the police were quite sure that Frank had invented  him|0.3804|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  Then, just when things were looking very serious for  Frank, the report on the Riddles’ bodies came back  and changed everything|-0.1513|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|set()
  The police had never read an odder report|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 A team of  doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded  that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed,  shot, strangled, suffocated, or (as far as they could  tell) harmed at all|-0.9136|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|set()
 In fact (the report continued, in a  tone of unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all  appeared to be in perfect health — apart from the fact  that they were all dead|-0.1531|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|set()
 The doctors did note (as  though determined to find something wrong with the  bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror  upon his or her face — but as the frustrated police  said, whoever heard of three people being frightened  to death?  As there was no proof that the Riddles had been  murdered at all, the police were forced to let Frank go|-0.9835|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|set()
  The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton  churchyard, and their graves remained objects of  curiosity for a while|-0.296|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|set()
 To everyone’s surprise, and amid  a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his  cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House|-0.128|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Frank Bryce', 'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|{'Muggle'}
  “ ’S far as I’m concerned, he killed them, and I don’t  care what the police say,” said Dot in the Hanged  Man|-0.3182|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 “And if he had any decency, he’d leave here,  knowing as how we knows he did it|-0.0516|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
”  But Frank did not leave|0.0572|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 He stayed to tend the garden  for the next family who lived in the Riddle House, and  then the next — for neither family stayed long|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|set()
  Perhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new  owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place,  which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall  into disrepair|-0.4767|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  The wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these  days neither lived there nor put it to any use; they  said in the village that he kept it for “tax reasons,”  though nobody was very clear what these might be|0.659|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|set()
  The wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the  gardening, however|0.2732|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Frank was nearing his seventy-  seventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer  than ever, but could be seen pottering around the  flower beds in fine weather, even though the weeds  were starting to creep up on him, try as he might to  suppress them|-0.0469|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  Weeds were not the only things Frank had to contend  with either|0.0516|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Boys from the village made a habit of  throwing stones through the windows of the Riddle  House|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|set()
 They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank  worked so hard to keep smooth|-0.2183|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Once or twice, they  broke into the old house for a dare|-0.4215|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 They knew that  old Frank’s devotion to the house and grounds  amounted almost to an obsession, and it amused  them to see him limping across the garden,  brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them|0.5667|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  Frank, for his part, believed the boys tormented him  because they, like their parents and grandparents,  thought him a murderer|-0.4767|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 So when Frank awoke one  night in August and saw something very odd up at  the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had  gone one step further in their attempts to punish him|-0.7178|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  It was Frank’s bad leg that woke him; it was paining  him worse than ever in his old age|-0.8519|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 He got up and  limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of  refilling his hot-water bottle to ease the stiffness in  his knee|0.3612|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he  looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights  glimmering in its upper windows|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|set()
 Frank knew at once  what was going on|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 The boys had broken into the  house again, and judging by the flickering quality of  the light, they had started a fire|-0.6705|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  Frank had no telephone, and in any case, he had  deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had  taken him in for questioning about the Riddles’  deaths|-0.3818|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|set()
 He put down the kettle at once, hurried back  upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was  soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing  a rusty old key from its hook by the door|-0.3818|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 He picked  up his walking stick, which was propped against the  wall, and set off into the night|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  The front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of  being forced, nor did any of the windows|-0.7351|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|set()
 Frank  limped around to the back of the house until he  reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took  out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened the  door noiselessly|0.1027|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  He let himself into the cavernous kitchen|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Frank had  not entered it for many years; nevertheless, although  it was very dark, he remembered where the door into  the hall was, and he groped his way toward it, his  nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any  sound of footsteps or voices from overhead|-0.5106|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 He  reached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to  the large mullioned windows on either side of the  front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing  the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it  muffled the sound of his feet and stick|0.5574|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  On the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once  where the intruders were: At the very end of the  passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light shone  through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across  the black floor|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Frank edged closer and closer,  grasping his walking stick firmly|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Several feet from  the entrance, he was able to see a narrow slice of the  room beyond|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  The fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate|-0.34|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 This  surprised him|0.2263|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Then he stopped moving and listened  intently, for a man’s voice spoke within the room; it  sounded timid and fearful|-0.7269|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  “There is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you  are still hungry|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
”  “Later,” said a second voice|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 This too belonged to a  man — but it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as  a sudden blast of icy wind|-0.4215|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Something about that  voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank’s  neck stand up|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 “Move me closer to the fire, Wormtail|-0.34|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Peter Pettigrew'}|{'Death Eater', 'Marauder'}
”  Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better  to hear|0.4404|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 There came the clink of a bottle being put  down upon some hard surface, and then the dull  scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across  the floor|-0.5106|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his  back to the door, pushing the chair into place|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 He was  wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald  patch at the back of his head|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Then he went out of  sight again|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  “Where is Nagini?” said the cold voice|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Nagini'}|{'Pet'}
  “I — I don’t know, My Lord,” said the first voice  nervously|-0.1531|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 “She set out to explore the house, I think|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  “You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,” said  the second voice|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Peter Pettigrew'}|{'Death Eater', 'Marauder'}
 “I will need feeding in the night|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 The  journey has tired me greatly|-0.4404|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
”  Brow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer  to the door, listening very hard|0.2975|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 There was a pause,  and then the man called Wormtail spoke again|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Peter Pettigrew'}|{'Death Eater', 'Marauder'}
  “My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay  here?”  “A week,” said the cold voice|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 “Perhaps longer|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 The  place is moderately comfortable, and the plan cannot  proceed yet|0.5106|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 It would be foolish to act before the  Quidditch World Cup is over|-0.2732|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
”  Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and  rotated it|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax,  he had heard the word “Quidditch,” which was not a  word at all|0.2755|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  “The — the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?” said  Wormtail|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Peter Pettigrew'}|{'Death Eater', 'Marauder'}
 (Frank dug his finger still more vigorously  into his ear|0.2006|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
) “Forgive me, but — I do not understand  — why should we wait until the World Cup is over?”  “Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are  pouring into the country from all over the world, and  every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on  duty, on the watch for signs of unusual activity,  checking and double-checking identities|-0.5927|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 They will be  obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice  anything|0.1779|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 So we wait|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
”  Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear|0.1779|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 He had  distinctly heard the words “Ministry of Magic,”  “wizards,” and “Muggles|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
” Plainly, each of these  expressions meant something secret, and Frank could  think of only two sorts of people who would speak in  code: spies and criminals|-0.5719|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Frank tightened his hold  on his walking stick once more, and listened more  closely still|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  “Your Lordship is still determined, then?” Wormtail  said quietly|0.34|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Peter Pettigrew'}|{'Death Eater', 'Marauder'}
  “Certainly I am determined, Wormtail|0.34|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Peter Pettigrew'}|{'Death Eater', 'Marauder'}
” There was a  note of menace in the cold voice now|-0.4939|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  A slight pause followed — and then Wormtail spoke,  the words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he  was forcing himself to say this before he lost his  nerve|-0.3182|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Peter Pettigrew'}|{'Death Eater', 'Marauder'}
  “It could be done without Harry Potter, My Lord|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
”  Another pause, more protracted, and then —  “Without Harry Potter?” breathed the second voice  softly|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"

 “The boy is  nothing to me, nothing at all! It is merely that if we  were to use another witch or wizard — any wizard —  the thing could be done so much more quickly! If you  allowed me to leave you for a short while — you know  that I can disguise myself most effectively — I could  be back here in as little as two days with a suitable  person — ”  “I could use another wizard,” said the cold voice  softly, “that is true|0.4361|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
”  “My Lord, it makes sense,” said Wormtail, sounding  thoroughly relieved now|0.4391|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Peter Pettigrew'}|{'Death Eater', 'Marauder'}
 “Laying hands on Harry  Potter would be so difficult, he is so well protected — ”  “And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a  substitute?

 perhaps the task of nursing  me has become wearisome for you, “Wormtail? Could  this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing  more than an attempt to desert me?”  “My Lord! I — I have no wish to leave you, none at all  “Do not lie to me!” hissed the second voice|-0.7186|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Peter Pettigrew'}|{'Death Eater', 'Marauder'}
 “I can  always tell, Wormtail! You are regretting that you ever  returned to me|-0.4574|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Peter Pettigrew'}|{'Death Eater', 'Marauder'}
 I revolt you|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()

 You  would not be here if you had anywhere else to go|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  How am I to survive without you, when I need feeding  every few hours? Who is to milk Nagini?”  “But you seem so much stronger, My Lord — ”  “Liar,” breathed the second voice|0.5004|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Nagini'}|{'Pet'}
 “I am no stronger,  and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of  the little health I have regained under your clumsy  care|-0.555|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Silencel”  Wormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell  silent at once|0.0|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Peter Pettigrew'}|{'Death Eater', 'Marauder'}
 For a few seconds, Frank could hear  nothing but the fire crackling|0.3724|58 The Riddle House  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()

  And then the solution came to him|0.3182|59 The Scar  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 It was so simple,  and so obvious, that he couldn’t believe it had taken  so long — Sirius|0.0|59 The Scar  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Sirius Black'}|{'Order of the Phoenix', 'Black Family', 'Marauders'}
  Harry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room,  and sat down at his desk; he pulled a piece of  parchment toward him, loaded his eagle-feather quill  with ink, wrote Dear Sirius, then paused, wondering  how best to phrase his problem, still marveling at the  fact that he hadn’t thought of Sirius straight away|0.7184|59 The Scar  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Sirius Black', 'Harry Potter'}|"{'Black Family', 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Marauders', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Golden Trio'}"

  There was a simple reason for Sirius’s complete  absence from Harry’s life until then — Sirius had  been in Azkaban, the terrifying wizard jail guarded by  creatures called dementors, sightless, soul-sucking  fiends who had come to search for Sirius at Hogwarts  when he had escaped|-0.5719|59 The Scar  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Sirius Black', 'Harry Potter'}|"{'Black Family', 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Marauders', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Golden Trio'}"
 Yet Sirius had been innocent  — the murders for which he had been convicted had  been committed by Wormtail, Voldemort’s supporter,  whom nearly everybody now believed dead|-0.5719|59 The Scar  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Sirius Black', 'Peter Pettigrew', 'Tom Marvolo Riddle'}|{'Black Family', 'Marauder', 'Death Eater', 'Marauders', 'Order of the Phoenix'}

 The Dursleys had never allowed  this before; their general wish of keeping Harry as  miserable as possible, coupled with their fear of his  powers, had led them to lock his school trunk in the  cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this|-0.5719|59 The Scar  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"

 Harry, on the other  hand, had liked them; they put him in mind of palm  trees and white sand, and he hoped that, wherever  Sirius was (Sirius never said, in case the letters were  intercepted), he was enjoying himself|0.9001|59 The Scar  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Sirius Black', 'Harry Potter'}|"{'Black Family', 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Marauders', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Golden Trio'}"

 Uncle  Vernon’s large red face was hidden behind the  morning’s Daily Mail, and Aunt Petunia was cutting a  grapefruit into quarters, her lips pursed over her  horselike teeth|-0.128|60 The Invitation  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Petunia Dursley', 'Vernon Dursley'}|{'Dursley Family'}

  Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to find  excuses for his bad marks as usual: Aunt Petunia  always insisted that Dudley was a very gifted boy  whose teachers didn’t understand him, while Uncle  Vernon maintained that “he didn’t want some swotty  little nancy boy for a son anyway|-0.4939|60 The Invitation  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Dudley Dursley', 'Petunia Dursley', 'Vernon Dursley'}|{'Dursley Family'}

 The school nurse had seen  what Aunt Petunia’s eyes — so sharp when it came to  spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls, and in  observing the comings and goings of the neighbors —  simply refused to see: that far from needing extra  nourishment, Dudley had reached roughly the size  and weight of a young killer whale|-0.7269|60 The Invitation  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Dudley Dursley', 'Petunia Dursley'}|{'Dursley Family'}

 The diet  sheet that had been sent by the Smeltings school  nurse had been taped to the fridge, which had been  emptied of all Dudley’s favorite things — fizzy drinks  and cakes, chocolate bars and burgers — and filled  instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of  things that Uncle Vernon called “rabbit food|0.3182|60 The Invitation  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Dudley Dursley', 'Vernon Dursley'}|{'Dursley Family'}

 What if Moody wanted to know  how he’d found out about the dragons? Would Moody  go to Dumbledore and tell on Hagrid, or just turn  Harry into a ferret? Well, it might be easier to get past  a dragon if he were a ferret, Harry thought dully, he’d  be smaller, much less easy to see from a height of fifty  feet |0.1943|77 The First Task  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Rubeus Hagrid'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Gamekeeper', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Golden Trio', 'Teacher'}"

  Harry went back to the castle later that afternoon  with Ron and Hermione, unable to banish the image  of the happy expression on Hagrid’s whiskery face as  he had imagined Harry winning the tournament|0.6369|81 Rita Skeeter’S Scoop  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Ron Weasley', 'Hermione Granger', 'Harry Potter', 'Rubeus Hagrid'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Gamekeeper', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Weasley Family', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Golden Trio', 'Prefect', 'Teacher'}"
 The  incomprehensible egg weighed more heavily than ever  on Harry’s conscience that evening, and by the time  he had got into bed, he had made up his mind — it  was time to shelve his pride and see if Cedric’s hint  was worth anything|0.5106|81 Rita Skeeter’S Scoop  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Cedric Diggory'}|"{'Hufflepuff', 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Champion', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Golden Trio', 'Hufflepuff Quidditch'}"

As Harry had no idea how long a bath he would need  to work out the secret of the golden egg, he decided to  do it at night, when he would be able to take as much  time as he wanted|-0.296|82 The Egg And The Eye  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
 Reluctant though he was to accept  more favours from Cedric, he also decided to use the  prefects’ bathroom; far fewer people were allowed in  there, so it was much less likely that he would be  disturbed|0.2716|82 The Egg And The Eye  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Cedric Diggory'}|{'Hufflepuff', 'Hufflepuff Quidditch', 'Champion'}
  Harry planned his excursion carefully, because he  had been caught out of bed and out-of-bounds by  Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once  before, and had no desire to repeat the experience|-0.1921|82 The Egg And The Eye  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Argus Filch'}|"{'Caretaker', 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
  The Invisibility Cloak would, of course, be essential,  and as an added precaution, Harry thought he would  take the Marauder’s Map, which, next to the cloak,  was the most useful aid to rule-breaking Harry  owned|0.4927|82 The Egg And The Eye  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
 The map showed the whole of Hogwarts,  including its many shortcuts and secret passageways  and, most important of all, it revealed the people  inside the castle as minuscule, labeled dots, moving  around the corridors, so that Harry would be  forewarned if somebody was approaching the  bathroom|0.2716|82 The Egg And The Eye  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
  On Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on  the cloak, crept back downstairs, and, just as he had  done on the night when Hagrid had shown him the  dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open|0.0|82 The Egg And The Eye  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Rubeus Hagrid'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Gamekeeper', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Order of the Phoenix', 'Golden Trio', 'Teacher'}"

  It was awkward moving under the cloak tonight,  because Harry had the heavy egg under one arm and  the map held in front of his nose with the other|-0.1531|82 The Egg And The Eye  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
  However, the moonlit corridors were empty and silent,  and by checking the map at strategic intervals, Harry  was able to ensure that he wouldn’t run into anyone  he wanted to avoid|-0.1027|82 The Egg And The Eye  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
 When he reached the statue of  Boris the Bewildered, a lost-looking wizard with his  gloves on the wrong hands, he located the right door,  leaned close to it, and muttered the password, “Pine  fresh,” just as Cedric had told him|-0.4019|82 The Egg And The Eye  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Cedric Diggory'}|{'Hufflepuff', 'Hufflepuff Quidditch', 'Champion'}

 It was softly lit by a splendid candle-filled  chandelier, and everything was made of white marble,  including what looked like an empty, rectangular  swimming pool sunk into the middle of the floor|0.6705|82 The Egg And The Eye  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()

 Magnificent though the  bathroom was — and quite keen though he was to try  out a few of those taps — now he was here he  couldn’t quite suppress the feeling that Cedric might  have been having him on|0.8155|82 The Egg And The Eye  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Cedric Diggory'}|{'Hufflepuff', 'Hufflepuff Quidditch', 'Champion'}
 How on earth was this  supposed to help solve the mystery of the egg?  Nevertheless, he put one of the fluffy towels, the  cloak, the map, and the egg at the side of the  swimming-pool-sized bath, then knelt down and  turned on a few of the taps|0.5423|82 The Egg And The Eye  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  He could tell at once that they carried different sorts  of bubble bath mixed with the water, though it wasn’t  bubble bath as Harry had ever experienced it|0.0|82 The Egg And The Eye  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
 One  tap gushed pink and blue bubbles the size of  footballs; another poured ice-white foam so thick that  Harry thought it would have supported his weight if  he’d cared to test it; a third sent heavily perfumed  purple clouds hovering over the surface of the water|0.6249|82 The Egg And The Eye  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"

  Then, when the deep pool was full of hot water, foam,  and bubbles, which took a very short time  considering its size, Harry turned off all the taps,  pulled off his pajamas, slippers, and dressing gown,  and slid into the water|0.0|82 The Egg And The Eye  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
  It was so deep that his feet barely touched the  bottom, and he actually did a couple of lengths before  swimming back to the side and treading water,  staring at the egg|0.0|82 The Egg And The Eye  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Highly enjoyable though it was to  swim in hot and foamy water with clouds of different-  colored steam wafting all around him, no stroke of  brilliance came to him, no sudden burst of  understanding|0.5709|82 The Egg And The Eye  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()

 He snapped it shut again, worried that the  sound would attract Filch, wondering whether that  hadn’t been Cedric’s plan — and then, making him  jump so badly that he dropped the egg, which  clattered away across the bathroom floor, someone  spoke|-0.5706|82 The Egg And The Eye  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Argus Filch', 'Cedric Diggory'}|{'Hufflepuff', 'Hufflepuff Quidditch', 'Champion', 'Caretaker'}

 The patched and ragged  Sorting Hat was standing on a shelf|0.0|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 A glass case next  to it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies  set into the hilt, which Harry recognized as the one he  himself had pulled out of the Sorting Hat in his  second year|0.5994|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"

 He looked around for the source of the  light and saw a sliver of silver-white shining brightly  from within a black cabinet behind him, whose door  had not been closed properly|0.3612|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Harry hesitated,  glanced at Fawkes, then got up, walked across the  office, and pulled open the cabinet door|-0.3182|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Fawkes'}|"{'Pet', 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"

 He could not tell whether the  substance was liquid or gas|0.0|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 It was a bright, whitish  silver, and it was moving ceaselessly; the surface of it  became ruffled like water beneath wind, and then,  like clouds, separated and swirled smoothly|0.7845|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()

 Lowering his face so that his  nose was a mere inch away from the glassy  substance, Harry saw that rows and rows of witches  and wizards were seated around every wall on what  seemed to be benches rising in levels|-0.25|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"

 He was  falling through something icy-cold and black; it was  like being sucked into a dark whirlpool —  And suddenly, Harry found himself sitting on a bench  at the end of the room inside the basin, a bench  raised high above the others|-0.2732|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
 He looked up at the  high stone ceiling, expecting to see the circular  window through which he had just been staring, but  there was nothing there but dark, solid stone|0.2263|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  Breathing hard and fast, Harry looked around him|-0.1027|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
  Not one of the witches and wizards in the room (and  there were at least two hundred of them) was looking  at him|0.0|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Not one of them seemed to have noticed that a  fourteen-year- old boy had just dropped from the  ceiling into their midst|0.0|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Harry turned to the wizard  next to him on the bench and uttered a loud cry of  surprise that reverberated around the silent room|-0.25|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
  He was sitting right next to Albus Dumbledore|0.0|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Albus Dumbledore'}|{'Order of the Phoenix', 'Headmaster', 'Teacher'}
  “Professor!” Harry said in a kind of strangled whisper|-0.623|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
  “I’m sorry — I didn’t mean to — I was just looking at  that basin in your cabinet — I — where are we?”  But Dumbledore didn’t move or speak|-0.0387|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 He ignored  Harry completely|-0.3182|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
 Like every other wizard on the  benches, he was staring into the far corner of the  room, where there was a door|0.3612|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  Harry gazed, nonplussed, at Dumbledore, then  around at the silently watchful crowd, then back at  Dumbledore|0.0|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
 And then it dawned on him|0.0|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  Once before, Harry had found himself somewhere that  nobody could see or hear him|0.0|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
 That time, he had  fallen through a page in an enchanted diary, right  into somebody else’s memory |0.0258|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 and unless he was  very much mistaken, something of the sort had  happened again|-0.4173|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  Harry raised his right hand, hesitated, and then  waved it energetically in front of Dumbledore ’s face|0.5719|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"

 Dumbledore wouldn’t ignore him  like that|0.0|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()

 the Dumbledore sitting next to him now  was silver-haired, just like the present-day  Dumbledore|0.3612|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 But what was this place? What were all  these wizards waiting for?  Harry looked around more carefully|0.3715|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
 The room, as he  had suspected when observing it from above, was  almost certainly underground — more of a dungeon  than a room, he thought|0.0534|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 There was a bleak and  forbidding air about the place; there were no pictures  on the walls, no decorations at all; just these serried  rows of benches, rising in levels all around the room,  all positioned so that they had a clear view of that  chair with the chains on its arms|-0.5719|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()

 The  door in the corner of the dungeon opened and three  people entered — or at least one man, flanked by two  dementors|0.0|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  Harry’s insides went cold|0.0|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
 The dementors — tall,  hooded creatures whose faces were concealed — were  gliding slowly toward the chair in the center of the  room, each grasping one of the man’s arms with their  dead and rotten-looking hands|-0.6486|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 The man between  them looked as though he was about to faint, and  Harry couldn’t blame him |-0.34|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter'}|"{'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
 he knew the dementors  could not touch him inside a memory, but he  remembered their power only too well|0.3919|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 The watching  crowd recoiled slightly as the dementors placed the  man in the chained chair and glided back out of the  room|0.0|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 The door swung shut behind them|0.0|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  Harry looked down at the man now sitting in the  chair and saw that it was Karkaroff|0.0|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Igor Karkaroff', 'Harry Potter'}|"{'Durmstrang', 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Death Eater', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
  Unlike Dumbledore, Karkaroff looked much younger;  his hair and goatee were black|0.0|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Igor Karkaroff'}|{'Durmstrang', 'Death Eater'}
 He was not dressed in  sleek furs, but in thin and ragged robes|0.0|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 He was  shaking|-0.1779|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Even as Harry watched, the chains on the  arms of the chair glowed suddenly gold and snaked  their way up Karkaroff’s arms, binding him there|0.0|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Igor Karkaroff', 'Harry Potter'}|"{'Durmstrang', 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Death Eater', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"

 “You have been brought from  Azkaban to present evidence to the Ministry of Magic|0.0|87 The Pensieve  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()

 When none appeared, he tried the  Reductor Curse again|-0.5423|88 The Third Task  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|['Reducto']|set()|set()
 It wasn’t very effective, but it  burned a small hole in the hedge through which  Harry forced his leg, kicking at the thick brambles  and branches until they broke and made an opening;  he struggled through it, tearing his robes, and looking  to his right, saw Cedric jerking and twitching on the  ground, Krum standing over him|-0.8626|88 The Third Task  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Cedric Diggory', 'Viktor Krum'}|"{'Durmstrang', 'Hufflepuff', 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Champion', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Golden Trio', 'Hufflepuff Quidditch'}"

 Harry dashed over to Cedric, who had  stopped twitching and was lying there panting, his  hands over his face|-0.6486|88 The Third Task  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Cedric Diggory'}|"{'Hufflepuff', 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Champion', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Golden Trio', 'Hufflepuff Quidditch'}"

  Every so often he hit more dead ends, but the  increasing darkness made him feel sure he was  getting near the heart of the maze|0.6655|88 The Third Task  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
 Then, as he strode  down a long, straight path, he saw movement once  again, and his beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary  creature, one which he had only seen in picture form,  in his Monster Book of Monsters|0.2263|88 The Third Task  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()

 He raised his wand, hesitating|-0.34|88 The Third Task  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()
  She was not crouching as if to spring, but pacing  from side to side of the path, blocking his progress|0.0772|88 The Third Task  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()

  “Okay,” he said|0.0|88 The Third Task  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|set()|set()

 Cedric was  sprinting as fast as he could toward the cup, and  Harry knew he would never catch up, Cedric was  much taller, had much longer legs —  Then Harry saw something immense over a hedge to  his left, moving quickly along a path that intersected  with his own; it was moving so fast Cedric was about  to run into it, and Cedric, his eyes on the cup, had  not seen it —  “Cedric!” Harry bellowed|0.0|88 The Third Task  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Cedric Diggory'}|"{'Hufflepuff', 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Champion', 'Gryffindor', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Golden Trio', 'Hufflepuff Quidditch'}"

 Once sure that Harry was  bound so tightly to the headstone that he couldn’t  move an inch, Wormtail drew a length of some black  material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it  roughly into Harry’s mouth; then, without a word, he  turned from Harry and hurried away|0.3182|89 Flesh, Blood, And Bone  |4 Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire|[]|{'Harry Potter', 'Peter Pettigrew'}|"{'Marauder', 'Potter Family', 'Gryffindor Quidditch', 'Death Eater', ""Dumbledore's Army"", 'Gryffindor', 'Golden Trio'}"
